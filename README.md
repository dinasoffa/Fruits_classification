## Introduction

Image classification is the process of categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. It is a fundamental task in computer vision and has a wide range of applications, such as object recognition, facial recognition, and medical image analysis. In this notebook, we will explore how to perform image classification using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I will be using a loaded dataset of images and their corresponding labels, preprocess the images, train a supervised learning model using the dataset, and evaluate the performance of the model.

## for classification I use :

### 1- simple CNN Model :
it is contain 2 conv layers, with augmentation on the data
